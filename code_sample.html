<!-- <h2>Create a simple web UI to display word counts.</h2>
<p>
Create a web-based UI (using the technology of your choice) that displays all unique words found in utterances within the log data in our demo database.<br>
Add to the UI some way for a user to filter which words are displayed by some specified minimum count. For example, show me all words found more than 10 times in the data.
<p>
<b>Look at code_sample.py for information about connecting to our MySQL database, and descriptions of the data within.</b>
<p>
<b>Note: This web page is not expected to connect in any way to code_sample.py. These are two separate tasks.</b> -->
